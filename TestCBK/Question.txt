Critique of the Current Site Navigation
*The current site navigation is ok. It could be better, for example maybe
adding a lightbox gallery or Modal Image Gallery. 
*The hamburger on top right of navbar when expanded could be further improve
for the user to see better.
*When you click the button it doesnt always go to the very start of the 
section and that can be improve for both mobile and destop
*The font color and size could be improve
*There could be a button to change the webpage into many different languages
*A search bar to search things
*The format could be better for tablet, mobile and desktop
